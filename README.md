# 🫀 ECG Decision Support System (ECG-DSS)

### Multi-Label ECG Arrhythmia Detection & Real-Time Monitoring System

---

## Project Overview

ECG-DSS is an **end-to-end deep learning–based clinical decision support system** for **multi-label ECG arrhythmia detection**, developed during a **time-bound AI/ML hackathon**.

The project covers the complete lifecycle:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- ECG signal preprocessing and dataset engineering
- Deep learning model design and training
- Multi-label validation and threshold optimization
- Deployment as a **real-time ECG monitoring dashboard**

The system detects **multiple co-occurring cardiac arrhythmias** from **12-lead ECG signals**, with strong emphasis on **robust decision-making, interpretability, and clinical realism**.

## 🔗 Live Demo (Streamlit Deployment)

👉 **Deployed Application:** [**https://ecg-decision-support-system.streamlit.app/**](https://ecg-decision-support-system.streamlit.app/)

> The live app allows uploading **preprocessed `.pk` ECG files** and simulates real-time multi-label arrhythmia detection with clinical decision support explanations.

---

## Problem Statement

Traditional ECG classifiers assume **single-label outputs**, whereas real-world ECG recordings may exhibit **multiple simultaneous arrhythmias**.

This project addresses:

> **Multi-label cardiac arrhythmia classification from variable-length 12-lead ECG recordings**, explicitly accounting for **class imbalance**, **label co-occurrence**, and **temporal variability**.

---

## Supported Arrhythmia Classes (9)

- **AF** — Atrial Fibrillation
- **LBBB** — Left Bundle Branch Block
- **RBBB** — Right Bundle Branch Block
- **PAC** — Premature Atrial Contractions
- **PVC** — Premature Ventricular Contractions
- **STD** — ST Depression
- **STE** — ST Elevation
- **Normal**
- **Other**

Each ECG sample may contain **multiple active labels simultaneously**.

## PHASE 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Key Observations

- High temporal variability and lead-specific ECG morphology
- Severe class imbalance (Normal and AF dominate)
- ~7% of ECGs contain **multiple simultaneous arrhythmias**
- Frequent label co-occurrence justifies multi-label modeling
- Lead correlations show shared cardiac activity with unique patterns
- Padding and temporal modeling are mandatory

> **Note:** Baseline correction is intentionally disabled to preserve clinically relevant ST-segment morphology.

---

## PHASE 2 – Preprocessing & Dataset Engineering

- Resampling to 250 Hz
- Duration normalization to 60 seconds
- Lead-wise normalization
- Multi-hot label encoding
- Memory-efficient `.pk` storage
- **Lazy loading** to prevent RAM exhaustion (Windows-safe)

---

## PHASE 3 – Model Architecture & Training

### Model Architecture

- 1D CNN with **ResNet-style residual blocks**
- Temporal feature extraction across 12 leads
- **Attention pooling** for temporal importance weighting
- Sigmoid activation for independent label probabilities

### Training Strategy

- Multi-label learning with **Focal Loss**
- GPU acceleration (CUDA / MPS / CPU fallback)
- Lazy dataset loading for scalability
- Real-time training progress with `tqdm`

### Evaluation Metrics

- Hamming Loss
- F1 Score (Macro & Micro)
- Per-class AUC-ROC
- Subset Accuracy (reported cautiously)

---

## PHASE 4 – Multi-Label Validation & Decision Optimization

Phase 4 focuses on **decision quality**, not representation learning.

- Binary Cross-Entropy vs Focal Loss (conceptual comparison)
- Explicit class imbalance handling
- Multi-label stratified data splitting
- Cross-validation strategy explanation
- **Per-class threshold optimization**
- Significant post-training metric improvement

> Subset accuracy remains inherently low due to its strict definition in multi-label tasks.

---

## PHASE 5 – Real-Time ECG Monitoring Dashboard

### Features

- Streamlit-based real-time ECG monitoring
- Upload preprocessed `.pk` ECG files
- Sliding-window simulation of live ECG streams
- CUDA-accelerated inference
- Optimized per-class thresholds
- Clinical decision-support explanations

> Explanations are **assistive**, not autonomous diagnoses.

---

## Hackathon Context

- Strict time constraints
- Solo participation
- Limited hardware reliability
- Emphasis on **end-to-end system completeness**
